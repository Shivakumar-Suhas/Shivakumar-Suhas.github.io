title: Finite Element Analysis of 3D Woven Composite
description: Engineered an indigenous 8-layer 3D woven composite in plain-weave architecture, optimized for L-stringers in aircraft wings. Applied Classical Laminate Theory (CLT) with micro- and macro-mechanics to derive stiffness formulations. Modeled stringers in CATIA V5, analyzed in ANSYS APDL, achieving +22% load capacity in Y-direction and +35% in Z-direction compared to 2D laminates. Findings published in Taylor & Francis (DOI: 10.1201/9781003216742).
