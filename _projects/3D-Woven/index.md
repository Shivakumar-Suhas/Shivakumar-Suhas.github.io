## Overview
This project designed and analyzed an **8-layer 3D woven CFRP** (plain-weave) tailored for **aircraft wing L-stringers**, targeting improved **out-of-plane strength and damage tolerance** relative to 2D laminates.

## Objectives
- Derive laminate stiffness for an orthogonal 3D woven architecture (CLT + micro/macro mechanics).  
- Build a **CAD + FEA** workflow to evaluate load capacity in **Y** (in-plane) and **Z** (out-of-plane) directions.  
- Benchmark against 2D laminated baselines.

## Methods
- **Constitutive modeling:** CLT for laminate A/B/D matrices; micro/macro links via **TexGen-style yarn geometry** and rule-of-mixtures refinements.  
- **CAD:** L-stringer geometry and layup references in **CATIA V5**.  
- **FEA:** Static structural analyses in **ANSYS APDL**; assessment of interlaminar response and local stress fields.

## Results & Metrics
- **+22%** increase in **Y-direction** load capacity.  
- **+35%** increase in **Z-direction** (out-of-plane) capacity vs. 2D laminates.  
- Work **published**: Taylor & Francis (**DOI: 10.1201/9781003216742**).

## What to look for in images
- Yarn-level schematic and equivalent orthotropic ply properties.  
- CATIA L-stringer geometry and FE mesh.  
- Loadâ€“displacement curves comparing 3D vs 2D laminates.

## Notes
- Material: carbon/epoxy; woven architecture tuned for **interlaminar performance**.  
- Failure interrogation with classical criteria where applicable; extended out-of-plane capacity is the principal gain.
