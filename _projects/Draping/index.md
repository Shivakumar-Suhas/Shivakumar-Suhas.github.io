title: "Implementation of a Machine-Learning Model to Optimize Composite Manufacturing"
description: "Collaborated with Premium Aerotec to optimize draping and preforming mechanics of Non-Crimp Fabrics (NCF). Conducted experimental draping trials under varied compaction loads, built ABAQUS draping models with 87% predictive accuracy, and reduced defect-prone regions. Processed test/simulation data for wrinkle detection and trained ML models, achieving RÂ² = 0.94 and MAE = 0.005, reducing experimental iterations and enabling process optimization."
