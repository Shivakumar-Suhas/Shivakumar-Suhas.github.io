title: Intern
description: During my internship at the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), India (June 2019 – August 2019) in Bengaluru, I performed calculations on the off-design performance of gas turbines and gained introductory experience with the Gasturb12 software for turbine analysis. In addition, I designed and conducted a static thermal analysis of a centrifugal impeller using ANSYS, where the simulations verified structural integrity under operational temperatures up to 850 °C using SS-316L material. Through this work, I also developed foundational knowledge in thermal stress management, fatigue resistance, and material behavior.reference.
