## Overview
This project focused on the **design, manufacturing, and characterization of aerospace-grade CFRP laminates**. It targeted improvements in **production efficiency, material performance, and structural validation** through experimental and simulation-based methods, while adhering to **ASTM, ECSS, and Airbus AIPI standards**.

## Manufacturing & Process Optimization
- **VARTM, AFP, and filament winding** used to fabricate aerospace-relevant laminates.  
- **Optimized filament winding machine parameters**, reducing wrinkle formation and compaction defects by **15–20%**, improving reproducibility and consistency of **both dry-fiber preforms and resin-impregnated laminates**.  
- Manufacturing workflows aligned with **aircraft quality and certification standards** (FAA/EASA guidance for composite components).

## Mechanical Testing
- Led **tension, compression, bending, fatigue, and cryogenic (–170°C) testing** in compliance with **DIN EN ISO 527, 14126, 14125, and ASTM standards**.  
- Generated high-quality datasets to support **design allowables** for aerospace applications, consistent with **ECSS and Airbus AIPI guidelines**.  
- Applied **2D and 3D Digital Image Correlation (DIC)** and video extensometry for accurate **stress-strain field measurements**.  
- Conducted **high-speed impact testing** using **high-speed cameras** to capture dynamic failure mechanisms in slow motion, supporting **certification-relevant validation**.

## Simulation & Analysis
- Developed **ABAQUS/ANSYS workflows** incorporating failure criteria and **damage evolution laws**, aligned with **ECSS material testing protocols**.  
- Achieved **>90% correlation** between simulations and experiments, reducing validation cycles by 15%.  
- Microscopy and **SEM analyses** evaluated fiber volume fraction, fracture morphology, and microstructural defects, providing feedback to optimize layup and curing quality per **aircraft material standards**.

## Industrial Collaborations
- Delivered outcomes in partnership with **MTU and WARR**, integrating **simulation-driven optimizations and defect modeling** into prototype design and process development, consistent with **FAA/EASA composite certification requirements**.
